1. Create dummy data
# target variable
data['Gender'] = ['male','male','male','male',
                  'female','female','female','female']

# feature variables
data['Height'] = [6,5.92,5.58,5.92,5,5.5,5.42,5.75]
data['Weight'] = [81,86,77,74,45,68,58,68]
data['Foot_Size'] = [12,11,12,10,6,8,7,9]

2. Input 1 test data to get prediction
3. Calculate no of male and female
4. get total observations
5. Find probability of male and female
6. Find mean and variance of data using groupby with gender
7. Get mean for every column for male and female
8. Get variance for every column for male and female
9. Build function for P(X|Y) and pass observation, mean and variance as argument
10. Use likelihood formula and the return the likelihood from function
11. find posterior probability for male and female by multiplying probability of male with every column's mean and variance
